# File Dockerization

# NOTE - Dockerfile [The ordered fashion of Steps to build an Docker image matters, otherwise the docker image will be corrupted, will take massive storage to build the image]

# FROM
# WORKDIR
# MAINTAINER
# RUN
# ADD
# COPY
# ENV
# EXPOSE
# CMD

# NOTE - Terminal Commands

# docker build -t <image-name> <path>
# docker run -p <port>:<port> -it <image-name>


# Docker Image - [Behavior]

 - Immutable [Onece built, it cannot be changed, with changed name new version will be created, with same name it will be overwritten by cached layer of existing image with new changes]
 - Light weight
 - Portable
 - Reproducible [version control, with re-name as <name:2> or <name:latest> etc new revamped image will be created]
 - Secure
 - Self contained
